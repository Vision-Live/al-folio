I have worked at a senior level in housing for over 20 years including 10 years as Chief Executive of 'TPAS' and 2 years as Executive Director of Tenant Services at the 'Social Housing Regulator'. I currently work as an independent consultant specialising in tenant scrutiny and involvement and as a non-executive in housing and health, including being Chair of 'Healthwatch Salford'. Currently I am the Vice Chair of the Guiness Partnership Board.
